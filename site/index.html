            <h1>The Archives</h1>
            <p>I first put gijs6.nl online somewhere in late 2024. Since then, I've completely rebuilt and redesigned it way more times than I probably should have. Each version was also a different view on design, code, or just what I actually wanted the site to be. Here are some of those old versions. I tried to fix most of the dead links, but I might have missed a few :)</p>

            <article>
                <h2><a href="/versions/v0">Rounded boxes</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>The original version with bilingual support. No consistent theme, just rounded boxes everywhere. The code is kind of a nightmare, but it has a vibe to it.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="/v0.png" />
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2><a href="/versions/v1">Monospaced</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>First version with an actual theme. Black and white, everything in monospace. Looking at it now, it's maybe a bit too uninteresting, but I like how simple it is..</p>
                </div>
                <img src="/v1.png" />
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2><a href="/versions/v2">Green and orange</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>I wanted something with a nice clean design. The layout is simple, and I spent way too much time on every little detail. This one also didn't use any external resources just plain HTML and CSS :D</p>
                </div>
                <img src="/v2.png" />
            </article>
