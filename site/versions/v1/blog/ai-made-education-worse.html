                <h1>Education was bad; AI made it worse</h1>
                <p>
                    AI can be an awesome tool for writing. I use it myself more often than I like to admit, and it is used a lot in my school.<br />
                    And that's a problem. School <em>should</em> be about teaching people important knowledge and skills, and maybe even more important, it should get people excited about learning. But if students just use AI to do their assignments, school clearly fails at that. And I completely understand that schools need to do something &quot;against&quot; using AI. But schools can't seem to do this right.
                </p>
                <p>My school just takes away our ability to use AI. For writing assignments, we work on a restricted Chromebook or just on paper. And this approach is wrong. Because it doesn't just block access to AI; it also limits our ability to do research and fully engage with the learning process. Until this year, we could just research on the Chromebooks, but this is now not possible during writing assignments. This kind of restriction turns education into something even more bureaucratic, tedious, and frustrating, which only pushes students further away from learning and makes them <strong>more</strong> likely to rely on AI.</p>
                <p>
                    What schools ideally want is that their students don't <em>want</em> to use AI. The experience of learning new things should be engaging and exciting. But that is not the case, and it wasn't the case before AI.<br />
                    And the students aren't the problem; the endless obsession with assignments, tests, and just accomplishing results is. These assignments, like the project from civics and the writing assignment from NLT, don't let students think about the subject. They just let the students answer some pre-defined questions, only to get some grade or result.<br />
                    And AI has removed all room to be curious (there wasn't much room before anyway). My school thinks that if you allow people to be curious, you allow them to use AI.<br />
                    The endless amount of boring, tedious, and repeating assignments make people forget that school can be fun. So for almost everyone, learning is not an interesting experience; it's a chore, so it's no wonder they would rather let AI do it.
