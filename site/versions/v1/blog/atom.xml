    <content type="html">&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1&gt;What is art?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining what art is isn't easy. According to the dictionary on my desk, art is &amp;quot;the result of the ability to creatively express emotions and thoughts&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
But that definition raises some questions. If you remove all traces of an artist from an artwork, is it still art? If you paint a canvas completely white, is that art? Is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence art? Is this blog art? Is simply everything humans create art, since you can't really make something without thinking about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say that &amp;quot;being art&amp;quot; isn't binary but more like a spectrum, you'd probably say that minimalistic and simple works are less art-ish, and big, detailed works are more art-ish. But does that mean 20 hours of white noise is more art-ish than 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence? Does that mean a 10-hour and 7-minute movie of paint drying is less art-ish than a simple cartoon? If you judge how art-ish something is based only on how much &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; it contains, you completely dismiss the story behind the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think you can't call something art just by observing it. You need to know the background, who made it, how it was made and why it was made, so you can interpret the emotions it is trying to convey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know that the 607-minute-long film about paint drying is a protest against censorship and the unfair costs facing independent filmmakers, then I think it's far more art-ish than a simple cartoon made for children. If you understand that an artwork represents emotions and thoughts, then it becomes meaningful. Context is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where it gets interesting. Take that banana duct-taped to a wall that everyone loves to mock. People dismiss it as &amp;quot;not real art&amp;quot; because it's just a banana. But maybe they're missing the point entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if that banana actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make you think? What if it forces you to question why we assign value to objects, why we create hierarchies of &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; culture, why we need things to be permanent and precious to matter? What if the absurdity is exactly the point: that in our desperation to categorize and commodify everything, we've lost sight of what actually makes us reflect on the world around us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't that &amp;quot;anything can be art.&amp;quot; The problem is that people think there should be gatekeepers deciding what counts. They want someone else to tell them what's meaningful so they don't have to do the &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; hard work of thinking for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to an even bigger problem: how schools completely miss the point of art education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;School ruins art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience, art class in school is where they teach what counts as &amp;quot;real art.&amp;quot; Instead of encouraging students to find meaning in their own experiences, schools don't let students explore what art can be. Classical music is &amp;quot;sophisticated,&amp;quot; but the song that made you cry at 3 AM isn't worth discussing. Oil paintings are &amp;quot;serious art,&amp;quot; but that meme you and your friends laugh at is just &amp;quot;internet culture.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part? Schools teach students that there are &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; interpretations of artworks. It feels like they have the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; interpretation of every artwork ever made, and theirs is the only correct one. No room for personal interpretation, no space for students to find their own meaning in the chaos. No consideration that maybe this painting speaks to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; feelings or thoughts. School treats art as if every artwork can be categorized by a few principles, and that's how it should be memorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actual meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is art, really? I personally think art is anything that creates genuine meaning in the realm of intention and interpretation. It doesn't matter if it's a Renaissance building or a niche shoegaze track; if it makes you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; something real, then it's functioning as art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art forces us to confront the fundamentals of being human. Why do we feel the need to create? Why do some patterns of sound or color move us to tears, while others don't affect us at all? Why do we desperately want to share our inner experiences with others, even though we can never truly know if they understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions don't have answers, and that's exactly what makes them worth asking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An OS to fix your damn sanity</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1&gt;An OS to fix your damn sanity (and it's not fucking macOS)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This rant (sorry, I mean blog post) contains some strong language. Please don't take it personally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="os-message" style="display: none;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ua-parser-js@1/dist/ua-parser.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    const parser = new UAParser();
    const os = parser.getOS().name;

    let message = "";

    if (os === "Linux") {
        message = "You're already on Linux. Good. You're one of the few sane ones. Stick around, maybe you'll enjoy the rant :)";
    }

    const el = document.getElementById("os-message");
    el.innerHTML = "&lt;strong&gt;" + message + "&lt;/strong&gt;";
    el.style.display = "unset";
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just be honest for a second. If you're even a little techy, there's a point where you have to stop tolerating bullshit. And when it comes to operating systems, the amount of bullshit is fucking huge. So here's my take; honest, slightly ranty, and yes, probably what you needed to hear a really long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch. If you are even slightly technical, just switch. Switch to Ubuntu, Debian, Arch (preferably), Gentoo, anything. Even if you aren't that technical, just switch to Mint or something. It is so fucking easy. I am definitely not the first person to tell you this, but just switch, dammit. Stop making excuses. Stop pretending it's fine. It's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows has just imploded. The changes between Windows versions are completely mental. XP and 7 were amazing. Just great. Unmatched design, great user experience, everything. But Microsoft thought it was better to just fuck up their OS, put popups and AI every-fucking-where. Cortana, Copilot, Teams bloat, OneDrive syncing crap; all of it. It's a never-ending firehose of trash. Windows is broken, but well, it is easy to use for non-techy people. And PowerShell is a great shell. But there is just so, so much wrong with Windows (THEY EVEN DARED TO FUCKING MESS WITH THE BSOD?!?!). Developing on Windows is doable (WSL is actually really great), but it's not the best. The system gets in your way, tries to suffocate you with updates, installs crap without your consent, and overall just treats you like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, it works. It's &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot;. But &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; isn't good enough anymore. Especially not if you're writing code, doing actual work, or just want your machine to be nice to you instead of treating you like a fucking child. &amp;quot;Fine&amp;quot; is what you tell yourself when you've given up. Don't be that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't even get me started on macOS. I have to admit, the hardware in the MacBooks is quite good, apart from the damn ports; how the fuck can you build a modern laptop without any fucking USB-A ports???? USB-C is great, but you can't just straight up remove USB-A ports??! And also not even HDMI(!??!?!?!?!), no audio jack, no Ethernet, nothing usefull. You need a fucking dongle just to live. Apple should just ship a damn dongle factory with every laptop. But apart from the hardware, macOS is just unusable. The window manager is the worst ever made, and it seems like Apple's favourite hobby is making your life harder&lt;!--(did I say harder? I mean *fucking suicidal* (oh wow I just said that, YEAH I DID, DEAL WITH IT))--&gt;. (Apart from the ecosystem; the integration with other Apple devices can be really good, but that is the last exception I'm making.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I already say that macOS is just fucking unusable? AND THE KEYBOARDS!!! I completely agree that the normal keyboard layout (and here I'm mostly talking about the Ctrl, Super, and Alt keys) is messy and very illogical, but it is just what people are used to. And then Apple has the &lt;em&gt;cOmManD&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;oPtIoN&lt;/em&gt; keys, and when you plug in an Apple keyboard, THE ALT AND SUPER KEYS ARE SWAPPED AROUND??? Oh, and if I'm talking about keyboards, let's talk about the worst design the world has ever seen: Apple's Magic Mouse. It is the answer to the question &amp;quot;how can we design a mouse that is unusable, ugly, messes up your wrist, and that you can't use when it is charging?&amp;quot; They nailed it. They fucking nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And writing software for Apple products is even worse. I recently had to build an extension, so I wanted to make it available for Safari (well, I didn't want that at all, but I had to). Of course, I couldn't install Safari on my own machine (Arch), of course I couldn't; imagine if Apple would actually make your life easy?! I had to get a MacBook. JUST MAKE YOUR BROWSER AVAILABLE ON EVERYTHING. If you want to, you can install Microsoft Edge on Linux and on macOS. You really can. If you want to, you should immediately contact a medical professional, but you can! But no, I had to use Xcode and just; holy shit I hate Apple so much (I don't know if you've noticed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: the developer experience is completely mental. Xcode is slow, bloated, and Apple arbitrarily enforces rules around code signing, App Store distribution, and device deployment. Everything is behind a solid wall, and it's not to protect people (because Apple products are supposedly fucking safe), it's to protect Apple's profit margins (because they don't have enough money already). Want to sideload? Fuck you. Want to distribute your app without a yearly developer tax? Fuck you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you have a MacBook or just another device that runs macOS, throw it out the window and buy something sensible. Since you were using Apple products, the rest will feel so fucking cheap for you. And guess what; the quality is also better (I know that is hard for Apple users to even imagine, but it is very much the fucking reality)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about macOS and Apple, let's talk about an actually great OS.&lt;br /&gt;
Linux gives you actual control. Real control. Your system doesn't fight you; it helps you. You decide how things work. And that scares people. But once you get used to it, there's no way you're going back to an OS that constantly fucks with you. No big decisions made for you (well, apart from the distro, I guess). No forced updates at 3AM. No bullshit &amp;quot;let's restart your machine just when you wanted to be productive because we said so.&amp;quot; No manipulative nudges, no mystery processes eating your RAM while doing God knows what. It's yours. Finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Windows since I was very small. And it's what I was used to. I didn't want to switch to Linux, because, well, change is messy. But I did. And holy shit, the difference is so little. If you just use a great desktop environment (Cinnamon is amazing), the change is really, really small. And with the internet as your friend, you can really find your way around Linux. You're not alone. You don't have to be a command line monk who recompiles Firefox in the middle of the night. You just need curiosity and a browser (and fucking ChatGPT will also answer your, ehmm... &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And stop making fucking excuses. Even for gaming, Linux is not as bad as people think. I have only had one game so far that just refused to work on Linux, but all the other games work just fine. And I know, I don't play big MMOGs, and I know some of those big titles don't run on Linux. But with Proton and all the other stuff, you can get 90% of your stuff running without pain. The other 10%? Deal with it or dual boot. Or go outside. Touch some grass. I don't care. And honestly, Valve is pushing Linux gaming harder than Microsoft ever did for its own platform. Steam Deck runs an Arch derivative, and it's doing just fine; thanks, Valve :).&lt;br /&gt;
And yes, sometimes you'll need to fiddle and fuck around and not know what the hell you're doing. But at least you're allowed to do that. Try doing that on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND HOLY SHIT, PACKAGE MANAGERS ARE AMAZING. No more fucking around with &lt;code&gt;.msi&lt;/code&gt; and random installers, just &lt;code&gt;paru -S &amp;lt;your favourite package&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or whatever package manager you're using. Installing anything is just fucking clean and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. You don't need to be a senior software engineer with 20 years of experience making an OS in assembly to use Linux. It's not some obscure system. It's just better. More stable, more transparent, more respectful of your time, your hardware, and your sanity. It's not even about &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot; as an abstract ideal, it's about being &lt;em&gt;treated like a competent human&lt;/em&gt; (not user, &lt;a href="https://geheimesite.nl/blog/stupid-terminology"&gt;don't say user&lt;/a&gt;). Someone who can think for themselves and doesn't need a trillion-dollar company deciding what's &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still using Windows or macOS, ask yourself two things: are you mentally stable (just kidding), and are you really okay with how bad things have gotten? You deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just switch. You'll thank yourself later. And if not, at least you'll stop screaming at your OS every damn day. Or at least scream about different things, actually cool things. Linux things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://archlinux.org/download/"&gt;Download Arch here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Education was bad; AI made it worse&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can be an awesome tool for writing. I use it myself more often than I like to admit, and it is used a lot in my school.&lt;br /&gt;
And that's a problem. School &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be about teaching people important knowledge and skills, and maybe even more important, it should get people excited about learning. But if students just use AI to do their assignments, school clearly fails at that. And I completely understand that schools need to do something &amp;quot;against&amp;quot; using AI. But schools can't seem to do this right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My school just takes away our ability to use AI. For writing assignments, we work on a restricted Chromebook or just on paper. And this approach is wrong. Because it doesn't just block access to AI; it also limits our ability to do research and fully engage with the learning process. Until this year, we could just research on the Chromebooks, but this is now not possible during writing assignments. This kind of restriction turns education into something even more bureaucratic, tedious, and frustrating, which only pushes students further away from learning and makes them &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; likely to rely on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What schools ideally want is that their students don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use AI. The experience of learning new things should be engaging and exciting. But that is not the case, and it wasn't the case before AI.&lt;br /&gt;
And the students aren't the problem; the endless obsession with assignments, tests, and just accomplishing results is. These assignments, like the project from civics and the writing assignment from NLT, don't let students think about the subject. They just let the students answer some pre-defined questions, only to get some grade or result.&lt;br /&gt;
And AI has removed all room to be curious (there wasn't much room before anyway). My school thinks that if you allow people to be curious, you allow them to use AI.&lt;br /&gt;
The endless amount of boring, tedious, and repeating assignments make people forget that school can be fun. So for almost everyone, learning is not an interesting experience; it's a chore, so it's no wonder they would rather let AI do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ruining an election system</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Dutch Government is ruining its election system&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch minister of the interior and kingdom relations Judith Uitermark (NSC) recently announced her plan to transform the Dutch election system by introducing a new system where 125 of the 150 members of the Second Chamber (the most important parliament in the Netherlands) would be elected via regional elections.&lt;a class='ref-inline' href='#ref-url-1'&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Her justification? It's to &amp;quot;strengthen the regional bond between voters and elected officials.&amp;quot; What a load of nonsense. Let's be clear: this is a step in the wrong direction, and it's a move that will ultimately weaken the very democracy in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break this down. The election for the Second Chamber is supposed to be a &lt;strong&gt;national&lt;/strong&gt; election, not a regional one. We already have regional elections: the Provincial Council elections (&lt;em&gt;Provinciale Statenverkiezingen&lt;/em&gt;). So, if there's an issue with regional representation, why on earth would you mess with the national system? If regional representation is flawed, FIX THE REGIONAL SYSTEM, don't mess with the national one. Once again, &lt;strong&gt;the Elections for the Second Chamber are national elections&lt;/strong&gt;, so everyone in the entire country should be able to vote for the same people, otherwise, it's just a bunch of completely separate regional elections which happen to be added up for one parliament. How can you justify a &lt;strong&gt;NATIONAL&lt;/strong&gt; election where your ballot differs depending on where you live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's just the start of the problems. Smaller parties will have their votes scattered across multiple districts, making it much harder for them to secure any seats at all. These parties, which rely on proportional representation, will see their votes effectively wasted.&lt;a class='ref-inline' href='#ref-url-2'&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; What's the point of voting if your vote doesn't even count? This is the kind of thing we see in places like the United States, where if you don't vote for one of the two main parties, you might as well not vote at all. That is not democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: systems where votes are effectively lost, like in the U.S., or where a party can get the minority of the votes, but the majority of seats in Parliament, like in the UK, are systems that are can generate simply &lt;strong&gt;undemocratic&lt;/strong&gt; outcomes. And now, the Dutch government is trying to take us down that very same path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to stop this before it's too late. I truly hope the Second Chamber, or the First Chamber, or hell, even the &lt;em&gt;Raad van State&lt;/em&gt; steps in to block this plan. At this point, I don't care where it comes from, just stop it. We cannot allow the Dutch election system to be ruined like this. We cannot allow the Dutch government to just abolish this core democratic principle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Goodbye Google Documents; hello Markdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I switched my summaries from Google Docs to &lt;a href="https://school.gijs6.nl"&gt;a simple static site&lt;/a&gt; with Markdown files hosted with Jekyll on GitHub pages. I was really fed up with the limited features of Google Docs and just the hassle with sharing the docs, so when I saw that my friend Robin had &lt;a href="https://school.geheimesite.nl"&gt;his own site with his own summaries&lt;/a&gt;, I made the switch. And it works amazing, even though the Jekyll documentation is so bad, and I needed to make some extra Python scripts to get all the functionality that I wanted, but it works; maybe I'll make &lt;a href="https://github.com/Gijs6/Barium"&gt;my own static site generator&lt;/a&gt; sometime ;).&lt;br /&gt;
I think my little switch to Markdown fits the bigger picture of the decisions that I and many others have made the last few years surrounding the internet and just technology in general. People are kind of done with big tech just being so incredibly powerful, and I am too. We depend on the technology of these companies every single day; never in the history of mankind have so few companies been so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Welcome to this &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that word &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; doesn't give you any information about what you can expect to find on this &amp;quot;frequently updated website&amp;quot;&lt;a class='ref-inline' href='#ref-url-1'&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;; &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; is a word without actually that much meaning to it.&lt;br /&gt;
Is a blog a place to talk about your latest projects? Is a blog a place to reflect on what you have achieved (&lt;em&gt;like a NLT-logboek&lt;/em&gt;)? Is a blog a collection of stories from a road trip through Western Senegal? Is a blog a place to rant about politics? Is a blog just an old place where people wrote things before Twitter existed? Is a blog a place to showcase your work and impress others? Should a blog be made out of lengthy essays with fancy references, or should it be made out of short messages about anything that is on someone's mind?&lt;br /&gt;
I think a blog can be all of those, and it definitely shouldn't be a precisely defined thing, &lt;strong&gt;and that is amazing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do not know the purpose of this blog, I just wanted to write some things, and I wanted a little place on the internet to store and show them, so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is probably the worst welcome post in existence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
