                <p><em>This rant (sorry, I mean blog post) contains some strong language. Please don't take it personally.</em></p>
                <p>Let's just be honest for a second. If you're even a little techy, there's a point where you have to stop tolerating bullshit. And when it comes to operating systems, the amount of bullshit is fucking huge. So here's my take: honest, slightly ranty, and yes, probably what you needed to hear a really long time ago.</p>
                <p>Switch. If you are even slightly technical, just switch. Switch to Ubuntu, Debian, Arch (preferably), Gentoo, anything. Even if you aren't that technical, just switch to Mint or something. It is so fucking easy. I am definitely not the first person to tell you this, but just switch, dammit. Stop making excuses. Stop pretending it's fine. It's not.</p>
                <p>Windows has just imploded. The changes between Windows versions are completely mental. XP and 7 were amazing. Just great. Unmatched design, great user experience, everything. But Microsoft thought it was better to just fuck up their OS, put popups and AI every-fucking-where. Cortana, Copilot, Teams bloat, OneDrive syncing crap; all of it. It's a never-ending firehose of trash. Windows is broken, but, well, it is easy to use for non-techy people. And PowerShell is a great shell. But there is just so, so much wrong with Windows (THEY EVEN DARED TO FUCKING MESS WITH THE BSOD?!?!). Developing on Windows is doable (WSL is actually really great), but it's not the best. The system gets in your way, tries to suffocate you with updates, installs crap without your consent, and overall just treats you like an idiot.</p>
                <p>And sure, it works. It's "fine". But "fine" isn't good enough anymore. Especially not if you're writing code, doing actual work, or just want your machine to be nice to you instead of treating you like a fucking child. "Fine" is what you tell yourself when you've given up. Don't be that person.</p>
                <p>And don't even get me started on macOS. I have to admit, the hardware in the MacBooks is quite good, apart from the damn ports; how the fuck can you build a modern laptop without any fucking USB-A ports???? USB-C is great, but you can't just straight up remove USB-A ports??! And also not even HDMI(!??!?!?!?!), no audio jack, no Ethernet, nothing useful. You need a fucking dongle just to live. Apple should just ship a damn dongle factory with every laptop. But apart from the hardware, macOS is just unusable. The window manager is the worst ever made, and it seems like Apple's favourite hobby is making your life harder<!--(did I say harder? I mean *fucking suicidal* (oh wow I just said that, YEAH I DID, DEAL WITH IT))-->. (Apart from the ecosystem; the integration with other Apple devices can be really good, but that is the last exception I'm making.)</p>
                <p>Did I already say that macOS is just fucking unusable? AND THE KEYBOARDS!!! I completely agree that the normal keyboard layout (and here I'm mostly talking about the Ctrl, Super, and Alt keys) is messy and very illogical, but it is just what people are used to. And then Apple has the <em>cOmManD</em> and <em>oPtIoN</em> keys, and when you plug in an Apple keyboard, THE ALT AND SUPER KEYS ARE SWAPPED AROUND??? Oh, and if I'm talking about keyboards, let's talk about the worst design the world has ever seen: Apple's Magic Mouse. It is the answer to the question "how can we design a mouse that is unusable, ugly, messes up your wrist, and that you can't use when it is charging?" They nailed it. They fucking nailed it.</p>
                <p>And writing software for Apple products is even worse. I recently had to build an extension, so I wanted to make it available for Safari (well, I didn't want that at all, but I had to). Of course, I couldn't install Safari on my own machine (Arch), of course I couldn't; imagine if Apple would actually make your life easy?! I had to get a MacBook. JUST MAKE YOUR BROWSER AVAILABLE ON EVERYTHING. If you want to, you can install Microsoft Edge on Linux and on macOS. You really can. If you want to, you should immediately contact a medical professional, but you can! But no, I had to use Xcode and just; holy shit I hate Apple so much (I don't know if you've noticed).</p>
                <p>Also: the developer experience is completely mental. Xcode is slow, bloated, and Apple arbitrarily enforces rules around code signing, App Store distribution, and device deployment. Everything is behind a solid wall, and it's not to protect people (because Apple products are supposedly fucking safe), it's to protect Apple's profit margins (because they don't have enough money already). Want to sideload? Fuck you. Want to distribute your app without a yearly developer tax? Fuck you again.</p>
                <p>So if you have a MacBook or just another device that runs macOS, throw it out the window and buy something sensible. Since you were using Apple products, the rest will feel so fucking cheap to you. And guess what; the quality is also better (I know that is hard for Apple users to even imagine, but it is very much the fucking reality)!</p>
                <p>Enough about macOS and Apple, let's talk about an actually great OS. Linux gives you actual control. Real control. Your system doesn't fight you; it helps you. You decide how things work. And that scares people. But once you get used to it, there's no way you're going back to an OS that constantly fucks with you. No big decisions made for you (well, apart from the distro, I guess). No forced updates at 3 AM. No bullshit "let's restart your machine just when you wanted to be productive because we said so." No manipulative nudges, no mystery processes eating your RAM while doing God knows what. It's yours. Finally.</p>
                <p>I used Windows since I was very small. And it's what I was used to. I didn't want to switch to Linux, because, well, change is messy. But I did. And holy shit, the difference is so little. If you just use a great desktop environment (Cinnamon is amazing), the change is really, really small. And with the internet as your friend, you can really find your way around Linux. You're not alone. You don't have to be a command line monk who recompiles Firefox in the middle of the night. You just need curiosity and a browser (and fucking ChatGPT will also answer your, ehmm... "simple" questions).</p>
                <p>And stop making fucking excuses. Even for gaming, Linux is not as bad as people think. I have only had one game so far that just refused to work on Linux, but all the other games work just fine. And I know, I don't play big MMOGs, and I know some of those big titles don't run on Linux. But with Proton and all the other stuff, you can get 90% of your stuff running without pain. The other 10%? Deal with it or dual boot. Or go outside. Touch some grass. I don't care. And honestly, Valve is pushing Linux gaming harder than Microsoft ever did for its own platform. Steam Deck runs an Arch derivative, and it's doing just fine; thanks, Valve :). And yes, sometimes you'll need to fiddle and fuck around and not know what the hell you're doing. But at least you're allowed to do that. Try doing that on macOS.</p>
                <p>AND HOLY SHIT, PACKAGE MANAGERS ARE AMAZING. No more fucking around with <code>.msi</code> and random installers, just <code>paru -S &lt;your favourite package&gt;</code> or whatever package manager you're using. Installing anything is just fucking clean and simple.</p>
                <p>So yeah. You don't need to be a senior software engineer with 20 years of experience making an OS in assembly to use Linux. It's not some obscure system. It's just better. More stable, more transparent, more respectful of your time, your hardware, and your sanity. It's not even about "freedom" as an abstract ideal, it's about being <em>treated like a competent human</em> (not user, <a href="https://geheimesite.nl/blog/stupid-terminology">don't say user</a>). Someone who can think for themselves and doesn't need a trillion-dollar company deciding what's "best" for them.</p>
                <p>If you're still using Windows or macOS, ask yourself two things: are you mentally stable (just kidding), and are you really okay with how bad things have gotten? You deserve better.</p>
                <p>Just switch. You'll thank yourself later. And if not, at least you'll stop screaming at your OS every damn day. Or at least scream about different things, actually cool things. Linux things.</p>
                <p>
